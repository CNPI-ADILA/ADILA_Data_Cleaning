AMASS (https://amass.website/infobox.aspx?pageID=101) is an open-access, offline application to automatically generate an AMR surveillance report using microbiology data and, if avaiable, hospital admission data. The application has now been updated to version 2.0, which was funded by the Wellcome Trust Institutional Translational Partnership Award (with MORU).

Several sites from countries across South East Asia use AMASS. The aggregated data from existing automated reports are publically available on the AMASS website (https://amass.website/infobox.aspx?pageID=104). These data have been downloaded (February 2022) and combined into AMASS_combined.xlsx (using data_prep.R) in preparation for integration into the ADILA project. Each sheet in AMASS_combined.xlsx contains the automated output from the AMASS app used to populate the site-specific reports. Please refer to /data_dictionary/AMASS_combined_data_dictionary.xlsx for further information. 

ADILA's primary AMASS collaborators are Direk Limmathurotsakul (direk@tropmedres.ac) and Cherry Lim (cherry.lim@ndm.ox.ac.uk, Cherry@tropmedres.ac).
